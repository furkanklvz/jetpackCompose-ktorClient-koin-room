# My Team App for Android ‚öΩÔ∏èüì±

This project aims to create a simple yet clean mobile application using Kotlin-based libraries, working with a Restful API and Room database. The app follows Clean Architecture and the MVVM pattern.

## Project Description

This application allows users to create and manage their profiles, select personalized football teams, and retrieve information about those teams from a Restful API. The app uses **Ktor Client** to make HTTP requests to external APIs, **Room** for local storage, and **Koin** for Dependency Injection. Additionally, **Coil** is used for image loading, and **Coroutines** & **Flows** are utilized for asynchronous data management. The UI is built using **Jetpack Compose**, providing a modern, declarative way to build the app's interface.

## Technologies Used üîß

- **Jetpack Compose:** UI is built with Jetpack Compose for a modern and declarative approach to Android development.
- **Ktor Client:** Sends HTTP requests to the Football API to fetch team data.
- **Room:** Manages local database operations for user profiles and personalized teams.
- **Koin:** Provides Dependency Injection to manage the app's dependencies.
- **Coil:** Handles image loading and caching.
- **Coroutines & Flows:** Manages asynchronous operations and reactive data streams.
